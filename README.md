# The Cloud Resume Challenge - AWS

## Project Overview
In this challenge, I built an HTML/CSS resume website hosted on AWS using a serverless architecture. The backend is powered by AWS Lambda and API Gateway, with visitor metrics tracked in DynamoDB. CloudFront is used to optimize site performance and ensure scalability. The entire infrastructure is managed with Terraform, and continuous deployment is set up using GitHub Actions.
